ReadMe.txt file for the ProsCons DM / ML Project

The Pros and Cons corpus of data was crawled from reviews of epinions.com concerning things such as digital cameras, printers and Strollers.

The MixedProsCons_train.txt file contains:
a collection of 2,000 examples of opinions that are labelled in XML format, marked <Pros>content</Pros> or  <Cons>content</Cons>
There are 981 Pro examples and 1019 Con examples.  

The MixedProsCons_test_nolabel.txt contains:
a collection of 43,875 examples of opinions that are unlabelled, that is they are all marked <Labs>content</Labs>

This data has been used for determining context dependent sentiment words, which are then applied to sentiment analysis of comparative sentences.  The same form of Pros and Cons data was also used in (Liu, Hu and Cheng, WWW-2005).
